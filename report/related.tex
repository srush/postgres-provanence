\begin{itemize}
\item Trio / LIVE \cite{widom2005trio, sarma2010live} 
  
Implements a technique for backward provenance by connecting derived tuples to the previous tuples. Unfortunately, this technique has very high space complexity and may not scale in practice. 

\item Panda \cite{ikeda2010panda} 

Panda is an early stage proposal for a general provenance system for data. This system does not propose a practical algorithm or language features for provenance. 

\item SciDB \cite{cudr√©2009demonstration}

The SciDB system proposes a provenance system. Current proposals have low space complexity but with non-trivial query time. 

\end{itemize}
